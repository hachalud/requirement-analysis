## Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the critical phase of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Its purpose is to provide clear insights into how software requirements are gathered, analyzed, and defined to ensure successful project execution.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Clarity and Understanding: It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
1. Requirement Gathering
Engage with stakeholders to collect initial requirements.
Use various techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops.
2. Requirement Elicitation
Refine and elaborate on the gathered requirements.
Use techniques like brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.
3. Requirement Documentation
Document the requirements in a detailed and structured format.
Use requirement specification documents, user stories, and use cases.
4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Analyze and prioritize the requirements.
Create models to visualize and understand the requirements.
5. Requirement Validation
Review and validate the requirements with stakeholders.
Define acceptance criteria and ensure traceability.
## Types of Requirements.
Functional Requirements 
Definition: Describe what the system should do.
Examples: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.
Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è
Definition: Describe how the system should perform.
Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.
## Use Case Diagrams.
Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).
Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.
## Acceptance Criteria.
Define clear criteria for feature completion.
Ensure criteria are specific, measurable, and agreed upon by stakeholders.
Successful Checkout Process

Given a user has selected at least one booking item (e.g., hotel room, flight),
When they click on the ‚ÄúCheckout‚Äù button,
Then they should be redirected to a summary page showing all booking details and total cost.
